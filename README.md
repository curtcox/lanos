# LANOS

This is the start of a local area network operating system.
The goal is to provide a platform for applications to make use of multiple
separate machines

- desktops
- laptops
- tablets
- phones

and all of the input and output devices that they have

- displays
- keyboards
- mice
- speakers
- cameras
- microphones
- sensors
- accelerometers

This code started with the [Getting Started](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) guide
of the Socket.IO website.

You can also spin up a free Heroku dyno to test it out:
