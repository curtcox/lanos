# LANOS

This is the start of a local area network operating system.
The goal is to provide a platform for applications to make use of multiple
separate machines

- desktops
- laptops
- tablets
- phones
- automation systems

and all of the input and output devices that they have

- displays
- keyboards
- mice
- speakers
- cameras
- microphones
- sensors
- accelerometers
- lights

The intent is to provide a platform for programs like a traditional operating system,
but also rules, triggers, and simpler abstractions that aren't typically associated
with operating systems. Systems to learn from and interoperate with include

- [OpenHab](https://www.openhab.org/docs/concepts/)
- [HomeAssistant](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/architecture/core/)
- [room-assistant](https://www.room-assistant.io)
- [PlaceOS](https://docs.placeos.com/)
- [ROS](https://www.ros.org/)

Look at the [issues](https://github.com/curtcox/lanos/issues) to see potential applications.
Feel free to add issues.

This code started with the [Getting Started](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) guide
of the Socket.IO website.

You can also spin up a free Heroku dyno to test it out:
